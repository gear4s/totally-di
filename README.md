# di-namic
Simple dependency injection container for Node

## Why?

- Frustration with the many non-SOLID architectural approaches to javascript application development, particularly in the Node context
- Large codebases using a loose, dynamic style become incredibly difficult to understand and test

So I decided to create my own DI framework to do things the way I want them to be done, and possibly shine a light for others along the way. For those following Agile principles (TDD, BDD), dependency injection should be a familiar concept.
